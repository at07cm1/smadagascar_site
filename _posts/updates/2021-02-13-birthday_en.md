Dear friends,

The 13th of February was a milestone date for our charitable movement. The marking of our 2-year anniversary had us looking
back and celebrating along with all of you. Today we would like to say that sometimes we must look outside our own backyards to realize how big the world is and how blessed we are. Thank you all for helping us! We will keep up the hard work for creating a world free of disparity and injustice.

Two years of Save Madagascar. Two years full of love and hard work.

A big thanks to Annie Ioannides for the delicious <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CakebyAnnieIoannides">cake</a>.
