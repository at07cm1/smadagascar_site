We want to say a **big thank you** for your support!

After a year of hard work, meticulous planning, and preparation, we went online a week ago when we launched our first [fundraising campaign](https://gogetfunding.com/savemadagascar/).

Your response was overwhelming, with people rushing from all over the world to support us in solving the urgent problems of Toliara.
Today, a week after we went online, we are delighted to share this world map presenting the regions of people joining us and supporting our mission.

We greatly appreciate the time you took to share our post, and feel blessed to see our team growing. We hope to be able to fight for the aims of Save Madagascar with your support for many years to come.
