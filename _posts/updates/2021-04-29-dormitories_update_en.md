**The dormitories project: A worldwide embracement that makes it come true!**

While approximately 650 days of the individual offering were spent to date, it was just 100 days that make the difference. A hundred days of team offering makes another goal of the Save Madagascar Foundation come true. Your support of our first fundraising campaign allows us to share the first photos of the construction of the dormitories. In photographs is the groundwork of the base of the buildings that appeared and the foundation of a new life for our kids. A new life without abuse, human trafficking, and child labor. A life closer to a school, clean water, to a better future full of love. Love that you offered through the chain of love that you have created. 

Thank you all. We are grateful.
