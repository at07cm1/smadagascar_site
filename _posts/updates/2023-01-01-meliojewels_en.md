Our friend and supporter, the jewelry designer *Katerina Melio* created a piece of art just for the movement. Silver or gold plated is a lovely piece of jewelry. Please, anyone who would like to buy the jewelry, contributing this way to the economic support of our new project, "[An Orphanage in Mananjary](https://smadagascar.com/current/2021/01/01/orphanage_en.html)" pre-order your own by sending a message to the accounts of the movement. The jewelry costs 35 euros. The amount concerns the manufacturing costs of the jewelry, which will cover the materials cost only, not the designer's working hours. The remaining amount will be given to the movement to supplement the amount for the orphanage construction.

We thank you all for your support, and of course, we hope you will hug this volunteering offer of art and love from an exceptional designer.

**Thank you, Katerina Melio!**
