As a legal entity, the metropolis is entitled to buy, build new and convert existing buildings for charitable purposes.

This made the built o of the metropolitan church of Toliara our first milestone in our journey to complete a set of infrastructure buildings in the vicinity.

Within a year, we managed to collect funding from individual donators and complete the build and registration of the local metropolis.

This allowed converting informal squatter settlements and slums to a formal built center for Toliara.
